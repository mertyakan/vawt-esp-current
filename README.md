This project; analyze current-voltage and humidity sensor for vertical axis wind turbine. We are using Nodemcu v3 esp8266. I bought INA3221 and will try it out.

We want;
1. How much electricity can we produce when the motor rotates?
2. What is the status of our battery health?
3. What is the amount of amps consumed?
4. An esp repo where we can analyze these from a single screen.
